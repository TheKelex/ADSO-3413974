-- Create the assignment table: which technician holds which service order.
-- The active_marker column holds the technician id while the assignment is
-- active and is null once it is released. Because active_marker is unique, a
-- second active assignment for the same technician is impossible at the
-- storage level, even under a concurrent retry. The check constraint keeps
-- active_marker consistent with is_active.
