-- Create the warranty table: the coverage issued over one intervention. The
-- expiration date is computed by the application as the issue date plus the
-- coverage in months and is persisted, so validity is read, never recomputed
-- from a rule that may have changed. The intervention cannot be removed while
-- a warranty points at it.
